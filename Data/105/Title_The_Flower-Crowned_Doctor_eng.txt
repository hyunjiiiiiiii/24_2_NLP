Long ago, in a small village, there lived a skilled surgeon. This doctor was extremely wise and kind. However, his unique feature was his head. Like a flower with weak roots, his hair slowly fell out over time. Seeing this, people began to call him the 'Flower Head Doctor'.

One day, a massive snowstorm hit the village. Everything was covered in white, and people could not leave their homes. Despite this snowstorm, the Flower Head Doctor went from house to house, treating patients.

One day, when the doctor opened the window, a huge snowball hit his head, causing a deep wound. The doctor was bleeding profusely, but the villagers could not go outside due to the snowstorm. Although they were concerned for the doctor, nobody could help.

Then, something special began to happen with the doctor's head. It was not his hair growing back, but instead, beautiful flowers began to bloom from his head. The flowers bloomed, covering the wound, and the doctor began to recover.

The villagers were moved by the miracle of the Flower Head Doctor. Instead of mocking him, they now admired him. Since then, whenever it snowed, the villagers would open the window with the Flower Head Doctor and embrace the snow. They all believed in the power of flowers that can bloom even in the snow, giving them great courage and hope.

So, to this day, in that village, the story of the Flower Head Doctor is passed down to their descendants, teaching them how important it is to never lose hope and bloom like a flower in any difficulty.
