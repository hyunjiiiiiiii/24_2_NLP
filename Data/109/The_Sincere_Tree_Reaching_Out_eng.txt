Once upon a time, there was a beautiful fruit tree surrounded by a fence. This tree was special because it bore fruits that shone like crowns.

The fruits were sweet and delicious, but they had a special power that made them impossible to pick easily. The king, who owned the tree, made many attempts to get the fruits but they all ended in failure.

The princess, the king's daughter, couldn't bear to see her father's sadness. So, she bravely approached the tree. The princess loved flowers since she was a child, so she approached the tree with the most beautiful flower she had grown.

As the princess stood before the tree and offered the flower, the tree moved gently. The fruit, shining like a crown, slowly descended and touched the princess's hand. In that moment, the princess realized the achievement of her courage and love.

When the princess returned to the palace with the crown-like fruit, everyone was amazed and cheered. The king was touched by his daughter's bravery and love and gave her his crown as a gift.

Since then, the story spread that the tree would give fruit to anyone who approached sincerely. The king taught his people the importance of love and courage, creating a kingdom where everyone could live happily.

So, this story reminds us that what's important is not power or wealth, but sincerity, love, and courage. The fruit tree showed that it's not about crossing the fence, but about approaching with sincerity. Perhaps now, we can take courage in facing the challenges in life.
