Once upon a time, there were two friends living in a house without a roof. Their names were Sun and Grass. Sun was a bright and warm child who knew how to smile, and Grass was always fresh and cheerful. They liked each other very much.

One day, a big tree started growing around their house. At first, they looked at it with wonder, but as the tree grew bigger and started to cover their house, they faced a problem. Sun couldn't give warmth anymore, and Grass couldn't spread its fresh scent.

Sun and Grass decided to talk to the tree about the issue. "You are causing trouble for us. Please don't grow too big," they asked. However, the tree refused, saying that it had the right to live as well.

But that night, the chimney, seeing Sun and Grass trying to solve the difficult problem, shed tears. Its tears turned into smoke and rose up into the sky. The smoke turned into clouds and formed a roof to protect the two friends.

The next morning, Sun and Grass saw sunlight shining through the gaps between the tree branches. They smiled at each other from the roof. They felt like they could now become friends with the tree.

From then on, Sun, Grass, the tree, and the chimney lived together, sharing what they needed with each other. Sun gave warmth, Grass provided freshness, the tree offered shade, and the chimney always released smoke to create a roof.

During their time together, they learned many things. Sun and Grass thought they needed their own space at first, but later realized that understanding and caring for each other were the most important things.

So, they decided to build a house where everyone could live together. They divided their roles, worked together, and had a great time.

They became true friends, understanding and caring for each other. Sun, Grass, the tree, and the chimney. They respected each other's characteristics and learned to cherish each other. The house they created was big enough for everyone to live happily.

They promised to continue on together, caring for each other and overcoming difficulties. Their story is still ongoing.
