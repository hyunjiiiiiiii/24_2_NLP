Every morning, sunlight streamed in through the window. Watching the sun rise was a joy for the boy to start his day. However, one day, the sun did not rise. Instead, thick black smoke rose from the chimney outside the window.

The boy went out of the house and walked past the grassy yard to under the trees. The scene he saw there was even more serious. The sun was obscured by the smoke coming from the chimney rising high above the roof.

The boy said to the people in the village, "Let's find the sun again. We all need the sun." At first, people shook their heads, but the boy's determination touched their hearts.

They gathered their courage and opened the door, walking towards the giant chimney that towered upwards. Inside, there were unknown machines and complex pathways. Could they find the sun if they followed this path? The boy used a tree branch as a staff and stepped inside the chimney.

The inside of the chimney was filled with darkness and smoke. However, the boy did not give up. He continued deeper and further into the chimney. Eventually, he reached the top of the chimney and confirmed that the black smoke was blocking the sun.

He saw a green roof made of grass. There, he saw people waiting for the sun to rise again. The boy's heart raced. Holding his wooden staff, he rushed towards the smoke.

"Sun! I found you!" The boy's voice echoed inside the chimney. And soon, the smoke gradually disappeared and the air cleared. The sun began to shine through the window again.

Thanks to the boy's courage and dedication, the people in the village were able to see the sun again. They opened the windows, played in the grassy yard, and rested under the shade of the trees. In their hearts, the warm sunshine of the sun was once again shining brightly.

Since then, the boy was known as an adventurer. His story was about courage to start beyond the chimney and open the door. And what they all discovered was that, even in the darkness, you can find the light.
