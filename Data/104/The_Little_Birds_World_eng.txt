The tree by the quiet pond had seen many things over the years. Under the tree, a small bird had built a nest, creating its own little world.

With thick clouds covering the sky, the small bird often gazed at them, dreaming. One day, the bird discovered a white house with windows and a chimney. Smoke rose from the chimney.

Curious, the small bird ventured inside the house to find everything different from its world. Sunlight streamed through the windows, brightening the room, while the smoke from the chimney offered warmth.

Observing people's lives for the first time, the small bird could hear their voices, movements, and even their thoughts. So, the bird started watching them every day from the tree.

One day, the bird saw people throwing something into the pond as it floated down. Curious, the bird flew to the pond early the next morning.

There, an odd object floated in the pond. Examining it, the bird realized it was a small wooden model of a house people had thrown in.

The bird brought the wooden model back to its nest and thought about the world created by people. Yet, it couldn't quite understand the warmth, the smoke, and the lives of people.

One day, the bird saw people cutting down trees in front of its nest to build their own homes. Realizing how people gathered wooden pieces to construct their homes, the bird decided to build its own house.

Collecting wooden pieces, the bird built a house with a roof, windows, and a chimney. Lighting a fire inside, smoke rose from the bird's house, giving warmth.

For the first time, the bird felt comfortable and safe in its own house. Watching clouds from the window, the bird pondered over people's world.

Eventually, the bird stopped watching people from the tree and focused on its own house. Connecting the human world with its own, the bird understood the two worlds intertwined.

No longer trying to understand the human world, the bird found happiness in living in its own world. It already comprehended and embraced the human world as a part of itself.
