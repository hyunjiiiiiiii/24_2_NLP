Once upon a time, there was a small village where warm sunshine poured into the fenced-off field. In that village, there was a communal orchard filled with flowers and fruits, a beloved place for all the villagers. Every morning, the villagers would come to the orchard, harvest fruits, and talk to each other, spending their daily lives together.

One day, the flowers and fruits inside the fence began to die. As if struck by an unknown illness, the flowers drooped withered and the fruits quickly rotted. The villagers were puzzled, but no one knew the cause of this phenomenon.

In the midst of this, the youngest boy in the village, Jinwoo, secretly entered the orchard. Jinwoo had a deep love for flowers and trees since he was young, often checking on the condition of the plants in the orchard. It was then that Jinwoo discovered something strange. A thick layer of dark moss covered the fence. It looked burnt black, unlike usual, and had changed at the same time the plants began to die.

Jinwoo diligently searched through numerous books at the library in search of a solution. It was in a scientific data book where he found information about the black moss. It was a specific type of mold that had the property of causing plants it came into contact with to rot. Armed with this knowledge, Jinwoo informed the villagers and they decided to find a way to remove the mold together.

They spared no time and effort to clean the fence of the orchard. Furthermore, they planted plants that were not affected by the mold in the orchard, transforming it back into a place full of vitality. Jinwoo also taught the villagers how to periodically check for the spread of the mold to prevent it from taking over the orchard again.

From that day on, the orchard within the fence regained its vitality once more. The flowers bloomed beautifully, and the fruits grew deliciously. The villagers were grateful for Jinwoo's wisdom and courage, and they thought of him with pride.

Through this story, we can see how important scientific knowledge is and how we can overcome difficulties with that knowledge.
