In a small village where tall trees towered, there was a pond filled with white clouds. Every evening, when the sun set, the clouds would briefly stop by the pond. However, one day, the pond was no longer able to see its reflection.

The view of the pond through the window became increasingly blurry. Seeing this, the pond worried quietly to itself. "What should I do now? If I can't be seen, what will happen if the clouds decide to go elsewhere?" And so, the pond asked the surrounding trees for help.

The trees were perplexed. But then, one tree suggested, "What if we try to catch the light from the roof? The roof receives sunlight every day." The trees agreed to the idea, and they all went in search of the sun.

They climbed up to the top of the roof in search of the sun. However, by the time they reached there, the sun had already set in the west. The trees felt disappointed, but were about to return to inform the pond when suddenly, the clouds descended from the sky and spoke.

"We don't need to be seen by you. We have observed your concern for us. We have felt your heart." 

Tears welled up in the pond's eyes at the clouds' words. As those tears fell into the pond, its reflection became clear once again.

From then on, even after sunset, the clouds continued to linger by the pond, and the pond and trees laughed together. The villagers learned of this story, and gazed at the pond and trees beyond their windows, finding happiness each day.

And so, the small village was filled with strong bonds of friendship and love, and the people realized that together, they could overcome any difficulty. They learned that the most important lesson was helping and understanding one another. This story continues to be widely shared among the villagers even today, reminding them of the importance of friendship, love, and mutual understanding.
