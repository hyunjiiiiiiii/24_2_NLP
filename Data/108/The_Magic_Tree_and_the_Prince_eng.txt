Once upon a time, there was a young prince who enjoyed playing in a beautiful garden full of pretty flowers and ripe fruits every day. However, one day, his father, the king, came to him and said, "My son, it is time for you to grow up and become a king. I believe in you enough to pass on the crown to you."

But in order to receive the crown, he had to pass a test. He had to find a magical tree and bring back its fruit. The tree was located at the top of the tallest mountain in the world, surrounded by a fence made of steel. The prince accepted this challenge and started his adventure.

As the prince climbed the mountain, he faced many difficulties. But he didn't give up. Deep within his heart, he held a sense of responsibility as a future king and a desire to be acknowledged by his father. And he continued to move forward, using the knowledge and experience he gained along the way.

Finally, the prince broke through the fence and reached the magical tree. But a greater trial awaited him. It was the tree's words, "If your heart is not pure, you cannot obtain my fruit." Hearing these words, the prince was momentarily lost in thought.

However, he gathered his thoughts. He realized that there was something more important than becoming a king. It was truthfulness, fairness, and a loving heart. He understood that with all of these in his heart, he was worthy of receiving the crown.

So, he spoke honestly to the tree. "I came this far to receive the crown, but now I want your fruit for a different reason. I want to teach people love, fairness, and truth." Hearing this, the tree shook, dropping a fruit.

When the prince returned, the king was amazed to see how much his son had changed. He had truly become a king. Without even receiving the crown, his heart was already filled with kingly qualities. Now, he was ready to lead his kingdom with love, fairness, and truth.

And from then on, the kingdom lived happily in peace. While the prince ruled as king and led his kingdom with love, fairness, and truth, the people learned to live happily. And they all recognized the prince as a true king.
