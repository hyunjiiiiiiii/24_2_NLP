Another day began in that way. The sun rose gently, and dew sparkled on the grassy lawn. The small tree in the center was still half asleep, not fully awake yet.

Next to the tree stood an old house, with a chimney always emitting smoke. But today was a little different. Instead of smoke, a faint light seeped out from the chimney.

Inside the house, a boy was looking out the window. Each time he saw the tree outside growing and its shadow getting longer, he became lost in thought.

"Why does everything change?" The boy opened the door, went out, and asked the tree about his thoughts. But the tree remained silent, not answering. Feeling melancholy at the tree's lack of response, the boy was disheartened.

Then one day, as he watched the sunrise, the boy realized. "The reason everything changes is because the world keeps turning." He approached the tree and said, "Tree, you're changing too. Your shadow changes when the sun moves, and your leaves change with the seasons. It's the law of the world turning." The boy no longer felt melancholy. He began to accept change and understand it.

So, the boy observed the world with the tree every day. He gained a deep understanding of the world. His knowledge grew larger than the tree's, and eventually, he became a true scientist who understood the world.

As time passed, the friendship between the boy and the tree continued, and they learned many things together by observing the world. Their story, along with the smoke rising from the chimney of the house, spread to the sky, teaching someone the value of love and knowledge. Their story became a blessing that marked the beginning, not the end.
